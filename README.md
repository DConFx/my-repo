#about
This project is a simple Flask application that demonstrates how to create routes and serve basic content.

The Simple Flask App project provides examples of creating routes and serving basic content using Flask, a lightweight web application framework in Python. It includes three routes:

1. `/`: Returns a welcome message.
2. `/info`: Returns a message indicating it's an API.
3. `/login`: Returns a login page.

#running
To run the Flask application, first ensure that you have Python installed on your system, preferably version 3.x or higher. Additionally, make sure Flask is installed by running pip install Flask in your terminal. Once you have the prerequisites installed, navigate to the project directory using the command line. Then, simply execute the app.py file by running python app.py. This will start the Flask development server locally. You can now access the defined routes by opening a web browser and visiting http://localhost:5000/, http://localhost:5000/info, or http://localhost:5000/login, depending on the route you want to access. Alternatively, you can use tools like cURL or Postman to send HTTP requests to these routes and view the responses.
